Submission for IIITB Hackathon

Overview
This project processes audio files by transcribing them into kannada text and the transcriptions and the corresponding english translations are input in a csv file called "transcriptions.csv" . The user is prompet to upload an audio file and to select a language of the audio(english/kannada). Our model then uses semantic search to find the answer in the dataset and returns the refined answer (using T5 AI model). 

Dataset
The dataset is stored in the data folder in this repository at "transcriptions.csv".
It contains transcription data and their corresponding translations for matching with the user-provided audio files.

Setup Instructions
Requirements
Google Colab is recommended for running the code

Python Packages:
speech_recognition
transformers
pandas
fuzzywuzzy
langdetect
google.colab
torch
ffmpeg
ipywidgets
deep_translator
pydub

Running the Project
Open the Notebook:

Open this repository in Google Colab by clicking this button: [
](colab link here).

Upload Audio Files:

You'll be prompted to upload an audio file (Kannada or English).
Audio files will be processed for searching for the dataset. the path to dataset (locally uploaded in github) will be in the main code.

Transcription and Matching:

The script will transcribe your uploaded audio into text using Googleâ€™s Speech-to-Text API.
The transcription will be matched with the dataset included in this repository for further refinement and analysis.

Refined Output:

Both Kannada and English transcriptions will be refined using a T5 model.
The refined answers will be displayed as output when the code is run. 

Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Run the following command to transcribe an audio file
python audio_transcription.py

Note:
If your audio is in another format, it will automatically be converted using FFmpeg.

Please view the screenshots uploaded in the repository (includes examples of working of the model with kannada audio upload and english audio upload)
